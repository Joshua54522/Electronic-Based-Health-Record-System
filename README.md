# Electronic-Based-Health-Record-System
This project has two main parts: one for doctors and employees, and one for admins. Doctors log in with a special ID and password to access patient records, pharmacy data, lab reports, and inventory. They can update stock and manage reports. Users can view detailed patient info and update their profiles.
